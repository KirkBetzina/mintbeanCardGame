                    <p>I am a Marine Corps Veteran, who served from 2005-2010. I deployed to Iraq in 2007 focusing on convoy operations in the Al Anbar Province. After the Marine Corps, I attended General Assembly SEI, the Los Angeles Film School and the University of Vermont and have worked in sales for several small companies. I'm excited to be changing careers into Full Stack Software Development.</p>
